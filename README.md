## Airfoil Analysis Toolkit

An automated toolkit built in MATLAB for the design and analysis of NACA airfoils. This project was engineered to streamline the tedious, manual process of aerodynamic performance assessment, enabling rapid prototyping and iterative design through a parametric approach.

### Key Features
* **Parametric NACA Airfoil Generator:** Quickly generates any NACA airfoil geometry based on user-defined parameters.
* **Aerodynamic Visualization:** Provides real-time visualization of airfoil shape and key aerodynamic performance metrics.
* **Automated Calculations:** Uses thin airfoil theory approximations to automatically calculate lift and drag coefficients, allowing for instant performance feedback.
* **Efficient Design Workflow:** Dramatically reduces the time required for initial airfoil analysis, allowing engineers to quickly evaluate a wide range of designs.

### How to Use
1.  Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-link]`
2.  Open the main script in MATLAB.
3.  Follow the in-script instructions to input NACA parameters and run the analysis.

### Future Development
* Integrate a panel method solver for more accurate lift and drag predictions.
* Add support for a wider range of airfoil families (e.g., Clark Y, Eppler).
* Develop a GUI for an improved user experience.
